# Chapter 4 - Environments & Libraries

## Objective
By the end of this chapter you will know how to setup a python virtual environment for managing and sharing installed libraries

## Introduction
As you saw in the exercises in the last chapter, coding is about taking a high level task and breaking it down into steps. Sometimes you come across a step that is so common that someone went ahead and solved it for everyone as a public library. This is such an important part of coding that people will often talk about developer community when choosing between programming languages. While programming, you should start to build a habit of constantly asking yourself "Has someone had to solve this problem before?" If the answer is yes then there's likely a library available. You will get better and better at this instinct as you start playing around with libraries, so lets get started with it. But wait... one more talk about versions. I swear it's the last one!
